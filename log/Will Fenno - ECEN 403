This week I worked on gathering more data for soybean crop images and redroot pigweed images.
I have started creating bounding boxes for labelling the data as either 0 - Crop or 1 - Weed.
For the rest of the week, I plan on working on the upcoming documents like the FSR and the midterm presentation.

09/24/2024
This week I augmented my data and split my dataset into Training, Validation, and Testing folders.
For the rest of the week I am finishing the FSR and ICD reports.

10/01/2024
This week I am starting to research and begin my model building.
The rest of this week I plan to complete my subsystem intro project.

10/08/2024
This week I completed my subsystem intro project.
I also researched which keras application I will implement into the WIZARD model.
I am beginning to build and tweak overfitting issues to train my model.

10/15/2024
This week I worked on the status update presentation and continued to build my machine learning model.
I have reseached and finalized my subsystem component selection and plan to order parts this week.

10/22/2024
This week I continued to edit model hyperparameters as well as work on decreasing the regression losses during training.
I plan to start building digital prediction code to test my model's performance on a test batch.

10/29/2024
This week I am still working on reducing losses for classificaiton and regression.
I am also able to run predictions on a test batch from my dataset to see how my ML model behaves.

11/05/2024
This week I began making the code for real time detection that my model will implemented in.
I plan to start preparing for the final presentation and work on my subsystem slides.

11/12/2024
This week I worked on the final presentation slides for my subsystem.
I am currently still making the real time detection code and will begin testing this week.

11/19/2024
This week I began real time detection testing by printing pictures of both crops and weeds and testing the models predictions.
I have also implemented code that saves any testing from the camera to a video file for viewing if needed.
I plan to edit this detection code and prepare for final demo.
