1/16/25 (Project Intro)
The high voltage subsystem takes 12VDC (car battery) and boosts the voltage up to ~80V to deliver to the “weed.” It is controlled by I2C signals from the Jetson so it is only charged when it is supposed to be. I also added a module that can monitor whether current through the “weed” meets a certain threshold. There is also a buck converter that delivers 5V at over 2A to power the Jetson. In 403, I was able to get the I2C working as intended using an Arduino to send the test signals. The high voltage worked properly as well, although I did have to make quite a few changes to the PCB. The 5V power supply is capable of sourcing 2A, although the voltage has more ripple than it should. 
This week, I will be modifying my schematics and PCB layout to reflect the changes I made during 403. Throughout the rest of the semester, I will be assisting with the implementation of I2C on the Jetson and designing a casing for my PCB and the Jetson. I will also be experimenting with the component values for the 5V power supply to try and smooth out the output.


1/23/25
Past Week:
- Updated Schematics
- PCB Layout/Routing is in progress
- Ordering PCB tomorrow

This Week:
- Redo calculations for 5V:2A power supply and choose components to test
- Inventory parts and order what I need


1/30
Past Week:
- Ordered PCB and parts (including test components for DC-DC converter)
- Met with German team about modifying hardware to reach ~1kV; they are in their exam cycle so progress on that will be slow until they are done with exams

This Week:
- Assemble PCB, verify functionality


2/6
Past Week:
- PCB still hasn’t arrived
- Testing on variations of 5V:2A power supply

This Week:
- Jetson I2C Functions
- Assemble PCB whenever it decides to arrive


2/13
Past Week:
- Verify Jetson I2C Functionality
- Task-specific I2C functions

This Week:
- PCB arrived today (Thursday 2/13), will be assembling this week


2/20
Past Week:
- Assembled, re-validated PCB

This Week:
- Jetson-to-PCB I2C testing and debugging


2/27
Past Week:
- Adjusted DC-DC converter to supply 5.2V rather than 5V to fix under-voltage issue when powering Jetson (added voltage divider between output and feedback)

This Week:
- Add level shifter in between I2C interface (Jetson uses 3.3V, my PCB uses 5V) and begin testing
- Begin 3D model of electronics casing


3/6
Past Week:
- Implemented level shifter for I2C, ran full test of weed detection -> zap delivered

This Week:
- 3D model and print casing


3/20
Past Week:
- Learned SolidWorks, started modeling casing

This Week:
- Finish modeling casing and print
- Documentation


3/27
Past Week:
- Casing is printing

This Week:
- Documentation


4/3

4/18
High voltage subsystem is fully complete and functional. It produces the desired 88V impulse, can be controlled by the computer vision subsystem, and successfully supplies power to the Jetson.
