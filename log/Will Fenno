This week I worked on gathering more data for soybean crop images and redroot pigweed images.
I have started creating bounding boxes for labelling the data as either 0 - Crop or 1 - Weed.
For the rest of the week, I plan on working on the upcoming documents like the FSR and the midterm presentation.
