- ConOps Report
- Created basic charge pump that multiplies input AC voltage to a DC voltage 4x the magnitude
  - Therefore, my current plan is to go 12VDC -> AC, then boost AC voltage using transformer, then use the above circuit to reach final DC voltage
- This week, I will work on reports due next Wednesday as well as the midterm presentation next Monday
  - This includes outlining a schedule for my subsystem and a block diagram
- I will also begin the Subsystem Introduction, which will help me become acclimated to using Altium

- Midterm Presentation
- FSR, ICD, Execution and Validation Plans
- I will complete the Subsystem Intro Project this week and begin research on microcontrollers and sensing contact with the plant

- Subsystem intro project will be completed tonight (had issue with my laptop that lasted thursday until today)
- Looked into DC-AC conversion and PWM controllers
- Found candidate GPIO extender chips that have I2C communication (PCAL6524 or similar with correct amount of IO pins)
- Upcoming week: finish subsystem intro project, simulate DC-AC conversion
