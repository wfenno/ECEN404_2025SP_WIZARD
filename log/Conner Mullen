- ConOps Report
- Created basic charge pump that multiplies input AC voltage to a DC voltage 4x the magnitude
  - Therefore, my current plan is to go 12VDC -> AC, then boost AC voltage using transformer, then use the above circuit to reach final DC voltage
- This week, I will work on reports due next Wednesday as well as the midterm presentation next Monday
  - This includes outlining a schedule for my subsystem and a block diagram
- I will also begin the Subsystem Introduction, which will help me become acclimated to using Altium

9/24/2024
- Midterm Presentation
- FSR, ICD, Execution and Validation Plans
- I will complete the Subsystem Intro Project this week and begin research on microcontrollers and sensing contact with the plant

10/1/2024
- Subsystem intro project will be completed tonight (had issue with my laptop that lasted thursday until today)
- Looked into DC-AC conversion and PWM controllers
- Found candidate GPIO extender chips that have I2C communication (PCAL6524 or similar with correct amount of IO pins)
- Upcoming week: finish subsystem intro project, simulate DC-AC conversion

11/5/2024
- PCB ordered, awaiting arrival
- Develop I2C master using arduino to simulate control signals coming from microprocessor

11/12/2024
- PCB soldering

11/19/2024
- Mistake found in alternating voltage generator (0 to 12V instead of -12 to 12V), peripheral PCB ordered to fix issue
- PCB validation started
  - 12V-5V buck converter cannot pull 2A without pulling more than 1A from bench power supply (1.9A output works fine)
  - I2C works properly
  - High current sensor works properly
  - Cockroft-Walton Generator works properly under no load, will continue to test under various loads in MOhm range
